## Description
I've wanted to learn Python for a few years but haven't touched it besides a quick lesson given to me by a friend. I've created an app where users can create an account, log in, and vote and comment on tech news articles by following a course module from my coding boot camp. 

In this Python tutorial I learned how to
- create a flask server
- manage database connections
- query a database using SQLAlchemy models
- create APIs to upvote and comment on posts.
- create APIs to add, update, and delete posts
- add data to dashboard templates.
- import custom filters into Jinja templates
- create login and logout routes.
- add error handling
- manage sessions
- protect dashboard and API routes.
